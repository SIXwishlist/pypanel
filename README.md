* Create sane and secure multi-user virtual hosting environments.
* Entirely written in Python using Fabric, Cuisine and other libraries.
* Virtual hosting environment should support Python, Ruby and PHP app development. Possible inclusion of Node.js.
* Support multiple database servers including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis and others.
* Support multiple web servers (if the need exists), only supporting Nginx initially.
* Centralized multi-server remote administration capabilities via a REST interface.
* User-level resource management including disk/bandwidth quotas, memory/cpu usage, etc.
